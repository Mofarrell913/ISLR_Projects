This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}

x = matrix(c(1,2,3,4),nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
x
y = matrix(c(1,2,3,4),2,2,byrow = TRUE)
y^2
set.seed(267994)
a = rnorm(50)
b = a + rnorm(50,sd = .1)
cor(a,b)
plot(x,y,xlab= "This is X", ylab = "This is Y",main = "plot of X over Y")


```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
```{r}

y=x
f=outer(x,y,function (x,y)cos(y)/(1+x^2))
contour(x,y,f)
contour (x,y,f,nlevels =45,add=T)
fa=(f-t(f))/2
contour (x,y,fa,nlevels =15)

```


```{r}
library(tidyverse)

library(ggplot2)
colleges = read.csv("college.csv")

rownames(colleges) = colleges[,1]

colleges = colleges[,-1]
summary(college$Outstate)
pairs(colleges[,1:10])
boxplot(colleges$Outstate,colleges$Private)
```

```{r}
library(MASS)
ggplot(data = Boston) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = Boston$crim, y = Boston$lstat, colour = Boston$medv))
ggplot(data = Boston) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x=  Boston$crim, y= Boston$tax))
