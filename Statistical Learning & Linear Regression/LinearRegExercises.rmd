This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}

library(ISLR)
library(MASS)
library(tidyverse)
library(car)

auto = read_csv("Auto.csv",na = c("?","NA"))
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).
predict(lm.fit, data.frame(lstat = c(5,10,15)),interval = "confidence")
```{r}
fit1 = lm(mpg~horsepower, data = auto)
summary(fit1)
predict(fit1,data.frame(horsepower = c(98)),interval = "confidence")
ggplot(data = auto,aes(x = horsepower,y=mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
pairs(colleges[,1:10])

```{r}
pairs(auto[,1:8])
cor(auto[,1:8])
lm_multi = lm(mpg~.-name,data = auto)
summary(lm_multi)
```

```{r}
set.seed(1)
X = rnorm(100, mean = 0, sd = 1)
eps = rnorm(100, mean = 0, sd = .25)
Y = -1 + .5 * X + eps
line = lm(Y~X)
summary(line)
ggplot() + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = X, y = Y)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", mapping =  aes(x = X, y = Y)) +
  geom_abline(slope=.5, intercept=-1, color="red")

```


```{r}
polyLine = lm(Y~poly(X,2))
summary(polyLine)
```

With this first collinearity example, we can reject the null hypothesis for x1 but not x2 if our cuoff is .05
Plotting just Y and x1, we can reject the null hypothesis of x1 not causing y due to the large t and small p values
Plotting just Y and x2, we can reject the null hypothesis of x2 not causing y due to the large t and small p values
THere is no contradiction, as x1 and x2 are collinear. Their effects on y are harder to distinguish when plotted together

```{r}
set.seed(1)
x1=runif (100)
x2=0.5*x1+rnorm (100)/10
y=2+2*x1+0.3*x2+rnorm(100)

ggplot() +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = x1, y = x2))
collinear = lm(y~x1+x2)
l1 = lm(y~x1)
l2 = lm(y~x2)
summary(l1)
summary(l2)

```



```{r}
x1 = c(x1,.1)
x2 = c(x2,.8)
y = c(y,6)
l1 = lm(y~x1)
l2 = lm(y~x2)
summary(l1)
summary(l2)
```
