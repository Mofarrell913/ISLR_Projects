This is problem 5 of ISLR's Chapter 9 Applied Section
"We have seen that we can fit an SVM with a non-linear kernel in order
to perform classification using a non-linear decision boundary. We will
now see that we can also obtain a non-linear decision boundary by
performing logistic regression using non-linear transformations of the
features."

# Part A and B - generate a data with n = 500 and p = 2, and the observations belong to two classes with a quadratic decision boundary
set.seed(1)

x2 = runif(500)-.5

train = sample(1:500,500*.7)
