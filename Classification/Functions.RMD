This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
Power <- function() {
  print(2^3)
}

Power2 <- function(x,a) {
  print(x^a)
}

Power3 <- function(x,a) {
  return(x^a)
}
PlotPower <- function(interval,a) {
  y = rep(0,length(interval))
  j = 1
  for(i in interval) {
    y[j] = Power3(i,a)
    j = j+1
  }
  ggplot() + 
    geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = interval, y = y))
}
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

PlotPower(-5:5,5)

```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
