This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 


Fits LDA Classifier to Smarket data using Lag1 and Lag2 as inputs
Prior probabilities are pi-hats for the respective classes
Group means shows the estimates for mu hat -> the average of each predictor in the two classes
Coefficients of Linear Discriminants showcases pretty much is the decision boundary

```{r}
library(ISLR)
library(MASS)
train = (Smarket$Year < 2005)
Smarket.2005 = Smarket[!train,]
dim(Smarket.2005)
Direction.2005 = Smarket$Direction[!train]
lda.fit = lda(Direction~Lag1+Lag2, data = Smarket, subset = train)
lda.fit
```

class contains LDA's predictions about the movement of the market
posterior -> kth column contains posterior probabilities for the kth class
x contains the linear discriminants
Uses predictions for LDA
```{r}
lda.pred = predict(lda.fit,Smarket.2005)
names(lda.pred)
lda.class = lda.pred$class
table(lda.class,Direction.2005)
mean(lda.class==Direction .2005)
```

Can alter the threshold values

```{r}
sum(lda.pred$posterior[,1]>=.5)
sum(lda.pred$posterior[,1]>=.3)
```


Quadratic Linear Discriminant Analysis is fitted to the model, and the accuracy rate of test data is shown below
60% accuracy rate -> better than chance
```{r}
qda.fit = qda(Direction~Lag1+Lag2,data=Smarket,subset = train)
qda.fit
qda.class=predict (qda.fit ,Smarket.2005) $class
table(qda.class,Direction.2005)
mean(qda.class == Direction.2005)

```

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
